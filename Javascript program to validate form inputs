JavaScript Program to Validate Form Inputs

Form validation using JavaScript is the process of checking user
input fields in a web form before submitting the data to the
server. It ensures that required fields are not empty and that
inputs like email addresses follow the correct format. JavaScript 
validation improves data accuracy, prevents invalid submissions,
and enhances user experience by showing error messages instantly
without reloading the webpage.

Common validations include:

   Checking empty fields
   Validating email format
   Password length verification
   Numeric or text input checking
